#Technical task - project "Dream Job"

In this block, we will talk about creating web applications in the Java language.

#Description.

We will use Spring boot as the main library, but we will not go into the details of this framework. This will be in the Spring block.

The main task of this block is to understand the architecture of web applications.

We will develop the "Dream Job" application.

There will be two models in the system: vacancies and candidates. Candidates will post resumes. HR will publish job vacancies.

Candidates can apply for a job. The personnel officer can invite a candidate for a vacancy.
